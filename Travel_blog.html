        <h2>🌴 Kerala Trip</h2>
        <p class="trip-description">
            Kerala, often called "God's Own Country," gave me a perfect mix of beaches, backwaters, hills, and culture. 
            This unforgettable journey covered Kochi, Kozhikode, Thekkady, and Alleppey — from colonial streets to serene houseboats. 
            We spent around 6–7 days exploring different landscapes, each place offering a completely different vibe.
        </p>

        <h3>Kochi</h3>
        <p class="trip-description">
            Kochi was our first stop and the perfect introduction to Kerala. We explored Fort Kochi, walked along the promenade
            near the iconic Chinese fishing nets during sunset, and visited charming cafes tucked inside colonial-style buildings.
            The streets were filled with art galleries, spice markets, and vibrant murals. We also visited Mattancherry Palace
            and enjoyed shopping for souvenirs in Jew Town. Evenings were peaceful, with sea breeze and stunning golden skies.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h3>Kozhikode</h3>
        <p class="trip-description">
            Kozhikode (Calicut) had a calm coastal charm. We visited Kozhikode Beach in the evening where the sunset
            painted the sky in beautiful shades of orange and pink. The local street food was unforgettable — especially
            banana chips and traditional Malabar snacks. Walking along the shore with cool sea breeze and watching locals
            gather made the experience feel authentic and lively.

        </div>

        <h3>Thekkady</h3>
        <p class="trip-description">
            Thekkady was all about greenery and wildlife. We visited Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary and took a peaceful
            boat ride on Periyar Lake, hoping to spot elephants and deer near the water. The cool climate and misty hills
            were a refreshing change from the coastal heat. We also explored spice plantations where we learned about
            cardamom, pepper, and cinnamon cultivation — the aroma in the air was unforgettable.

        </div>

        <h3>Alleppey</h3>
        <p class="trip-description">
            Alleppey was the highlight of the trip. Staying overnight in a traditional houseboat on the backwaters
            was a surreal experience. As the boat slowly cruised through narrow canals lined with coconut trees,
            we watched village life unfold — children waving from the banks and fishermen casting nets.
            The peaceful water reflections during sunset and the calm silence at night made it one of the most
            relaxing travel experiences I’ve ever had.

        <h2>🏰 Jaipur Trip</h2>
        <p class="trip-description">
            Jaipur, the Pink City of India, was a royal experience filled with majestic forts, colorful bazaars,
            grand palaces, and rich Rajasthani traditions. We spent around 3–4 days exploring the architectural
            beauty and cultural vibrance of Rajasthan’s capital. Every monument had a story of kings, queens,
            battles, and timeless craftsmanship.
        </p>

        <h3>Hawa Mahal</h3>
        <p class="trip-description">
            Our mornings began at Hawa Mahal, the iconic "Palace of Winds." The intricate honeycomb-like windows
            (jharokhas) were designed so royal women could observe street festivals without being seen.
            Standing in front of the pink sandstone façade during sunrise was magical — the soft golden light
            made the entire structure glow beautifully. The view from the top offered a glimpse of the bustling
            old city markets below.
        </p>

        <h3>Amber Fort</h3>
        <p class="trip-description">
            Amber Fort was the highlight of Jaipur. Located on a hilltop, the fort overlooks Maota Lake
            and showcases a blend of Rajput and Mughal architecture. Walking through its grand courtyards,
            Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace), and royal halls made us feel like we had stepped back in time.
            The mirror work inside Sheesh Mahal sparkled even with minimal light — a true masterpiece of design.
            The panoramic view from the fort walls was absolutely breathtaking.
        </p>

        <h3>City Palace</h3>
        <p class="trip-description">
            City Palace stands proudly in the heart of Jaipur and reflects royal elegance.
            The Mubarak Mahal and Chandra Mahal sections display royal costumes, weapons,
            and artifacts that narrate Jaipur’s history. The beautifully painted doors in the courtyard
            were perfect for photographs. The blend of Mughal and Rajasthani architecture gave the palace
            a unique charm.
        </p>

        <h3>Local Markets & Culture</h3>
        <p class="trip-description">
            Exploring Johari Bazaar and Bapu Bazaar was an experience in itself.
            From colorful bandhani dupattas and mojris to handcrafted jewelry and souvenirs,
            the markets were full of life and energy. We also tasted authentic Rajasthani cuisine
            including dal baati churma and ghewar. The warmth of the locals and the vibrant
            pink-toned streets made Jaipur feel lively and welcoming.
        </p>
